Wrote about 4000 Characters, rough lifetime of a keyboard is 15m characters, but probably space key or maybe "a" may die earlier than this.

Used:

* two {{Monitor}}s
* external {{Keyboard}}
* one {{Graphic tablet}}
* {{Office}}
* Talked to Fabrizio and Chris, so their resources were also being used while speaking to me.
